# Setup

After you pull the project we can use docker-compose.
But first you have to have docker installed in your machine.
After you installed it;
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
This will create the Microservices, PSQL database, RabbitMQ and also create the necessary tables inside PSQL database.

## Testing

You can find the test files inside the webservice/ and also i can also share the export of my Postman requests.
